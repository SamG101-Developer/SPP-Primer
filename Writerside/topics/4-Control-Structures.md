# 4. Control Structures

There are 4 main control structures in S++

| Name   | Description                        |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| `case` | Conditional branching              |
| `loop` | Conditional looping                |
| `with` | Contextual block                   |
| `else` | Else block (for `case` and `loop`) |

There are no unconditional branching (`goto`) or looping (`loop` with no condition) expressions. Unconditional branching
is unstructured, and as there are no `break` or `continue` statements, unconditional looping is useless.
