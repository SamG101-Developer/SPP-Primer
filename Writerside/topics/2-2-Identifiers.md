# 2.2. Identifiers

S++ has two types of identifiers: type identifiers and value identifiers. Type identifiers must use `PascalCase`, while
value identifiers must use `snake_case`. Identifiers can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

The `PascalCase` naming convention is used for type identifiers because it allows them to stand out as being important.
The first letter must be uppercase, and the rest of the letters can be any case. Traditionally, each word in the
identifier is capitalised, but this is not a strict requirement as it is non-enforceable.

The `snake_case` naming convention is used for value identifiers as typing in snake case is faster, and due to the
powerful type inference, types do not have to be written as often. This also allows for value identifiers to be clearly
distinguished from type identifiers.
